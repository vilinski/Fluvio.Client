# Fluvio C# Client - Production Readiness Assessment

**Last Updated:** November 11, 2025
**Version:** 1.0.0-alpha
**Rust Client Version Compared:** v0.23+ (October 2024)

> **⚠️ Outdated — describes the pre-rewrite architecture.** This assessment predates the FFI rewrite
> (see `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-25-rust-ffi-rewrite-design.md`), which replaced the pure-managed
> wire-protocol client this document describes with a thin wrapper around the official `fluvio` Rust
> client via FFI. Features this document marks as shipped — record headers, the Polly-based retry
> pipeline, circuit breaker, and the custom wire-format encoder — were removed as part of that rewrite
> and are **not** present in the current client. See `README.md` for the current, accurate feature set.

## Executive Summary

The Fluvio C# client has **achieved production readiness** for most use cases. All critical gaps identified in early development have been addressed:

✅ Retry logic with exponential backoff (Polly)
✅ ILogger integration throughout
✅ Circuit breaker pattern
✅ Metrics and distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry)
✅ Automatic reconnection
✅ TimeProvider for testability
✅ Configuration validation
✅ TLS support

**Current Risk Level:** 🟢 **LOW** for production use

## ⚠️ **Partial Parity - Minor Gaps vs. Rust**

### Medium Priority (Nice-to-Have)

#### 1. Producer Callbacks

**Rust:** `ProducerCallback` API for async produce completion events
**C#:** ❌ Not implemented
**Impact:** LOW - Can track offsets returned from `SendAsync`
**Workaround:** Use returned offsets + metrics for tracking

#### 2. Producer Configuration Options

**Rust:** `batch_queue_size`, `max_request_size`, `timeout` per-producer
**C#:** ❌ Not exposed in ProducerOptions
**Impact:** LOW - Defaults work for most use cases
**Workaround:** Client-level timeouts apply

#### 3. Consumer Retry Modes

**Rust:** `RetryMode::Disabled`, `TryUntil(n)`, `TryForever`
**C#:** ❌ Not configurable
**Impact:** LOW - Circuit breaker handles failures
**Workaround:** Circuit breaker + retry policies at connection level

#### 4. Admin Watch API

**Rust:** `watch_topics()`, `watch_partitions()`, `watch_spus()` (streaming metadata)
**C#:** ❌ Not implemented
**Impact:** LOW - Poll with `ListTopicsAsync` for metadata changes
**Workaround:** Periodic polling (efficient for most use cases)

### Low Priority (Not Needed)

#### 5. Topic Producer Pool

**Rust:** `TopicProducerPool` for reusing producers
**C#:** ❌ Not needed - lightweight producer creation
**Impact:** NONE - Producer is lightweight, DI handles lifecycle

#### 6. Mirror Consumer

**Rust:** `mirror` option for consuming from mirror topics
**C#:** ❌ Not implemented
**Impact:** NONE - Edge feature, rarely used

#### 7. Platform Version Check

**Rust:** `MINIMUM_PLATFORM_VERSION` check on connect
**C#:** ❌ Not implemented
**Impact:** NONE - Protocol compatibility handled at runtime

---

## ❌ **Removed Features (Intentionally Not Implemented)**

### Compression (Removed 2025-11-04)

**Reason:** Fundamental incompatibility between .NET and Rust compression libraries
**Status:** ❌ Will not be implemented unless Fluvio explicitly supports client-side compression
**Details:** See `COMPRESSION_FORMAT_ANALYSIS.md`

### Multi-Partition Consumer (Deprecated in Rust v0.21.8)

**Reason:** Deprecated in Rust client, not recommended pattern
**Recommended:** Use one consumer per partition (already supported)
**Status:** ❌ Will not be implemented (matches Rust recommendation)
